She was mean to the cactus because she thought she was prettier.

Why do you think the father used an egg, a potato, and tea? What do you think they represent *before* they went into the hot water? Just take a guess, there's no wrong answer here!

You said the potato is like someone tough who becomes soft when things get hard. Can you think of a time when something like that might happen to someone?

You've shown how the potato can represent someone who seems tough but is actually vulnerable. How about the egg? You said it's fragile to begin with. Can you think of a time when someone who *starts* feeling weak or fragile might react to a difficult situation? What might happen to them? Maybe they become stronger, maybe something else!

You know, between your golden-egg-laying dog and my diamond-sweater-knitting cat and this farmer's ticklish goose, we could make a fortune!\n\nBut let's be *slightly* serious for a moment amidst all this silliness. (Leaning in conspiratorially) You came up with some WILD ways for the farmer to get more eggs. But what was the *real* problem with the farmer? Was it just that he didn't have enough *good* ideas? Or was something else going on inside his head? What was he feeling that made him do such a silly thing?"
